# TypeScript Dependency Injection Framework Package - Copilot Instructions

This project is a TypeScript dependency injection framework called "conduit" that provides modern DI capabilities with decorators, containers, and type safety.

## Project Structure

- `/src` - Main source code for the DI framework
- `/lib` - Compiled output directory
- `/tests` - Test files using Jest
- `/examples` - Usage examples and demos

## Development Guidelines

- Use TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- Follow dependency injection design patterns
- Implement decorator-based service registration
- Provide type-safe container resolution
- Include comprehensive unit tests
- Support both constructor and property injection

## Key Features Being Implemented

- Service container with lifecycle management
- @Injectable decorator for automatic registration
- @Inject decorator for dependency resolution
- Support for singleton and transient scopes
- Circular dependency detection
- Type-safe service resolution
